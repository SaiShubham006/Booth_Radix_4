# Booth_Radix_4
This module implements an N-bit signed radix-4 Booth multiplier in Verilog. It efficiently multiplies two signed numbers using overlapping triplets of the multiplier, generating partial products of 0, ±A, or ±2A. Supports FPGA verification and handles proper sign-extension for accurate 2N-bit results.
